      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <p>
        Rock Paper Scissors is a simple hand game played between two players. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes:
        rock, paper, or scissors.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rock</strong> beats scissors (rock crushes scissors).</li>
        <li><strong>Scissors</strong> beats paper (scissors cut paper).</li>
        <li><strong>Paper</strong> beats rock (paper covers rock).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The goal is to choose a shape that beats your opponentâ€™s choice. If both players choose the same shape, the game is a draw.</p>
